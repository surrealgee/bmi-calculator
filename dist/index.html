        <p>
          Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
          body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant
          of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate
          your overall health and well-being.

          <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
          <p>
            A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
            Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
            health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for
            a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating
            ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
            physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a
            week.
